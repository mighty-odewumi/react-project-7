# react-project-7


Built a Notes taking app that saves your notes even on page refresh.   

I learnt how to save to the localStorage.

 
### I didn't add the whole React files but that's on purpose. Would probably deploy later but that is how I would do the remaining projects too.


Here are the screenshots of the page on the localhost.
